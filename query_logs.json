        "answer": "The treatment of neonatal hypothyroidism typically involves giving the child a medicine called thyroxine. This medicine helps to replace the thyroid hormone that the body is not producing enough of. Once the child starts taking thyroxine, regular blood tests are done to ensure that the thyroid hormone levels are within a normal range. It is also recommended to refer the child to a pediatric endocrinologist, a specialist who deals with hormone-related issues in children, for ongoing care. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial because most of the effects of hypothyroidism are easy to reverse."

        "answer": "Based on the provided context, jaundice in newborns can be related to breastfeeding in two ways, but it doesn't necessarily affect the ability to breastfeed. Here's how they are related:\n\n1. **Breastfeeding jaundice**: This happens in the first week of life when babies do not nurse well or the mother's milk is slow to come in, leading to dehydration. It encourages more frequent feeding (about 10 to 12 times each day) to ensure the baby is getting enough milk.\n\n2. **Breast milk jaundice**: This appears after the first week of life and is likely caused by factors in a mother's milk that help the baby absorb bilirubin (a substance that causes the yellow color in jaundice) from the intestine and factors that keep certain proteins in the baby's liver from breaking down bilirubin.\n\nSo, jaundice doesn't directly affect the ability to breastfeed, but it might be a sign that the baby needs to feed more frequently or that the mother's milk is still coming in. If you're unsure, always consult a healthcare professional."
